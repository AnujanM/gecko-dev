The mozilla team added some backwards compatibility with the box offset parent in another fix. Due to that a check later one is not required anymore. Fixing it will remove the redundant check leading to a slight performance upgrade but more importantly removing redundancies. Risks of this change would be any changes to the earlier fix or a backout would need to be linked to this change as well and modified if necessary.

In terms of testing, when accessing the box model getting offset parent should still work when accessing devtools.

Below is a screenshot of the box model being accessed after the patch was made.
